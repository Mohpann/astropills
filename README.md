# Uncommon Hacks UChicago
This was developed at Uncommon Hacks Makes at the University of Chicago on 11/11/23. Our prompt was to come up with a future food system for astronauts (collab with alt protein subject) and figure out how to make astronauts excited about it.
We decided to make a single page application in React.js with an interactive button game at the end to demonstrate learned knowledge from the React.js workshop seminared during the hackathon.
